# Leave Management System (Serverless AWS)

A cloud-native **Leave Management System** built using AWS serverless services that enables employees to apply for leave, managers to review requests, and organizations to manage leave balances efficiently. The application follows a scalable, event-driven architecture and demonstrates backend engineering principles using AWS.
